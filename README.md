# I want to make better code for the whole holding the right trigger and the left one to shoot
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/command-compositions.html
i want to use the race command to make it so there is a 3 second wait command and a command that runs until the trigger is let go.
So if the person lets go while the motor is still speeding up, it will stop that race, this will definitely be better than the mess i made :(
