# Thunderbots Blue (7167)

This is the code for our robot for the mini competition thingy we are hosting at our school !
One of my first times coding for FRC so there will be some bad code, but I'm trying my best to improve the code

# TODO
```
- Make the code for the shooting and loading better.
- Switch the code to be command based instead of whatever I'm doing.
```
