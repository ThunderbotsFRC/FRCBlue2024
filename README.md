Things to do:
```
- I want to make better code for the whole holding the right trigger and the left one to shoot
- i want to use the race command to make it so there is a 3 second wait command and a command that runs until the trigger is let go.
= So if the person lets go while the motor is still speeding up, it will stop that race, this will definitely be better than the mess i made :(
```
